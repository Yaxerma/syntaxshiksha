#Setting Up Your Environment

To start writing C++ code, you need to set up your development environment. Here are the tools you need:

- Visual Studio Code with the C++ extension
- g++ compiler for compiling C++ code

Once your environment is set up, you can write your first C++ program:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

This program outputs "Hello, World!" to the console. The `#include` directive includes the Input-Output stream library, and `cout` is used to display the output.

Key points to remember:
- Always include necessary header files
- The main() function is the entry point of your program
- Use cout for output and cin for input
- End each statement with a semicolon
